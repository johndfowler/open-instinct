# Application database

This directory owns the eight application tables and their domain query
services.
Better Auth continues to own and migrate its tables independently in
`auth.ts`.

- `schema/` is the Drizzle source of truth.
- `index.ts` exports the Drizzle client and schema using pooled `DATABASE_URL`
  for request-time access.
- `services/` owns workspace-scoped application queries by domain.
- `drizzle.config.ts` uses `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` for migration commands.
- `migrations/` is generated history. Run `pnpm db:generate` after changing the
  schema and commit the SQL, snapshot, and journal together.

Run `pnpm db:migrate` explicitly for local or operator-managed environments.
Vercel runs the uncached Turbo `db:migrate` task before `build:vercel`. The
package command delegates directly to `drizzle-kit migrate`. Migration commands
use `@next/env` to load the same root `.env*` precedence as Next.js; an injected
`DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` remains authoritative. Each Vercel environment must
therefore provide the direct URL for its intended database. Migrations must
remain backward compatible with the previously deployed application while a
rollout is in progress.

## Adopting an existing database

Migration `0000` supports both an empty database and one containing the tables
formerly created at request time. It preserves the existing text timestamp and
identifier representation, adds missing chat usage columns with safe defaults,
and installs new foreign keys and checks as `NOT VALID` when a table already
exists. PostgreSQL enforces those constraints for new writes immediately without
rejecting the deployment because of an unknown historical orphan.

Before validating historical rows, back up the database and audit the pending
constraints:

```sql
SELECT conrelid::regclass AS table_name, conname
FROM pg_constraint
WHERE NOT convalidated
  AND connamespace = 'public'::regnamespace
ORDER BY 1, 2;
```

Repair any reported ownership or value violations, then validate each listed
constraint in a controlled maintenance step:

```sql
ALTER TABLE <table_name> VALIDATE CONSTRAINT <constraint_name>;
```

Validation is intentionally not automatic in the first deployment because it
scans existing rows and could turn unknown legacy drift into a production build
failure. Once all constraints are validated, their definitions already match
the canonical Drizzle schema; no data rewrite or Better Auth migration is
required.
